    <p><strong>1. Rich in Nutrients</strong>
        Mangoes are loaded with essential vitamins and minerals:
        
        Vitamin C: Mangoes are an excellent source of vitamin C, which supports immune function, skin health, and the body’s ability to heal wounds. One medium mango provides around 100% of the recommended daily intake of vitamin C.
        Vitamin A: Mangoes are high in beta-carotene, which the body converts into vitamin A. This vitamin is essential for eye health, skin health, and a strong immune system.
        Folate: Mangoes contain folate, which is important for DNA synthesis and is especially beneficial for pregnant women to prevent birth defects.
        Vitamin B6: This vitamin plays a role in brain function and the production of red blood cells.</p>

        <p><strong> 2. Good for Digestion</strong>
        Mangoes are rich in fiber (especially soluble fiber), which helps improve digestive health by promoting regular bowel movements and preventing constipation.
        
        Enzymes: Mangoes contain an enzyme called amylase, which helps break down and digest starches, making digestion easier and more efficient.</p>

        <p><strong> 3. Boosts Immune System</strong>
        Due to their high vitamin C and A content, mangoes can help enhance the body’s immune function, making it easier to fight off infections and illnesses.</p>

       <p><strong>4. Supports Heart Health</strong>
        Potassium: Mangoes are a good source of potassium, which helps regulate blood pressure and supports proper heart function.
        Antioxidants: The antioxidants in mangoes, such as flavonoids, carotenoids, and polyphenols, help reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in the body, potentially lowering the risk of heart disease.</p>

        <p><strong> 5. Promotes Healthy Skin</strong>
        Vitamin C in mangoes plays a significant role in the production of collagen, which helps maintain skin elasticity and reduces the appearance of wrinkles.
        The antioxidants in mangoes also protect the skin from harmful free radicals that contribute to skin aging and damage from UV rays.</p>

        <p><strong>6. Weight Management</strong>
        Mangoes are relatively low in calories but high in fiber, which can help you feel fuller for longer and curb overeating.
        While they are naturally sweet, they have a low glycemic index, meaning they do not cause rapid spikes in blood sugar levels, making them a healthy choice for people looking to manage their weight or blood sugar levels.</p>

        <p> 7. Improves Eye Health
        Mangoes are rich in vitamin A (from beta-carotene) and lutein, which are both beneficial for eye health.</p>
    </section>
       <p> 8. Anti-Cancer Properties
        Mangoes contain antioxidants like quercetin, isoquercitrin, mangiferin, and vitamin C, which may help protect the body from oxidative stress and reduce the risk of certain types of cancer, particularly in the digestive system.</p>
    </section>
       <p>9. Improves Brain Function
        The vitamin B6 in mangoes is essential for brain health. It helps with the production of neurotransmitters, which regulate mood, memory, and cognitive function.</p>
    </section>
        <p>10. Helps Detoxify the Body
        Mangoes are a good source of water and fiber, which help cleanse the digestive system and promote kidney and liver health. Their high water content helps to flush toxins out of the body, contributing to better overall health.</p>
