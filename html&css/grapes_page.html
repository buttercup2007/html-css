            <li>Improving blood vessel function</li>
   <P><strong>3. Good for Eye Health</strong> 
    Grapes contain vitamin C and beta-carotene, which are both beneficial for eye health. These antioxidants help protect the eyes from age-related conditions like macular degeneration and cataracts.

   <p> <strong>4. High in Vitamins and Minerals</strong>
    Grapes are a good source of several essential vitamins and minerals, including:</p>
    
    <li>Vitamin C: Important for immune function, skin health, and wound healing.</li>
    <li>Vitamin K: Plays a crucial role in blood clotting and bone health.</li>
    <li>Potassium: Helps maintain proper heart function and regulates blood pressure.</li>
   <p><strong> 5. Improve Digestion</strong>
    Grapes are high in fiber, which promotes healthy digestion and helps prevent constipation. Fiber also supports gut health by feeding the beneficial bacteria in the digestive system.</p>

   <p> <strong>6. May Aid in Weight Management</strong>
    Grapes are low in calories and high in water content, making them a great hydrating snack that can help keep you full and prevent overeating. The natural sugars in grapes provide a healthier alternative to processed snacks.</p>
    
    <p>  <strong>7. Anti-Inflammatory Properties</strong>
    The antioxidants and phytonutrients in grapes have natural anti-inflammatory effects. Chronic inflammation is linked to many diseases, so consuming grapes regularly can help reduce inflammation in the body.</p>
    
    <p> <strong> 8. Support Skin Health</strong>
    The antioxidants in grapes, particularly vitamin C, play a vital role in collagen production, which is important for maintaining healthy, youthful skin. They can also help protect the skin from damage caused by UV rays and environmental stressors.</p>
    
    <p> <strong> 9. Boost Immunity</strong>
    Grapes are a good source of vitamin C, which helps to boost the immune system. This vitamin is essential for the production of white blood cells, which are responsible for fighting infections and diseases.</p>
    
    <p>  <strong>10. May Help Prevent Certain Types of Cancer</strong>
    Resveratrol and other antioxidants in grapes have been shown to help prevent the development of certain types of cancer by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, both of which can contribute to cancer cell growth.</p>
